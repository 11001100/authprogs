This program is a "C" implementation of http://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/articles/20030115.html

In order to use it, 'command=' option must be added in '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' file.

Ex. :
root@server:~$ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
command="/usr/bin/authprogs",no-port-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAA...KfM6= user@domain.com

Because the command is executed using the shell, authprogs will not work if 'no-pty'
option is added to authorized_keys file.
